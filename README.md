Although these files can be viewed directly in your browser in Github, some formatting changes and oddities may occur. I recommend that you clone the repository, install Jupyter, and view them locally for the best experience.

The web changes, libraries update, and make mistakes may make some of the programs to terminate abruptly, with or without producing required results. If you think you've spotted an error, please feel free to make a pull request against this repository.sdf
